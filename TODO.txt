Test rutines:
* No arguments
- install in archlinux live
- install in gentoo live
- install in systemrescue live
- install in debian live

* With arguments
install with root RSA
install with root password
install with custom_user + password 
install with custom_user + rsa
install with distcc 
install with stage4 
install with rsync (instead of stage3\4)
  - setting passwords\making cusom user
  - installing software
  - more?

Test on 2GB ram server (NOTE TO SELF: archlinux fails to boot on 2GB)

TODO:
- Rename variables and stuff to make more sense 
- Make a sumary with password, installed software, etc
- If partitions exist and is mounted i have to run the script twise, dunno why
- Add support for setting static ip, else use dhcpcd (and add it to rc-update????)
- instead of defining rsync mirror, use mirrorselect
- eselect profile set 1
- in rsync, redo fstab or sed change if partitions from source server is diffrent 

Idea:
- Make stage4 from template server
- Use rsync from a template server 
- after rsync, change snmpd.conf and munin-node.conf (change ip)???
- or can the template server have a script updating snmp and munin-node with current ip on eth0 ? :)
